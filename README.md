## Project Description
A Mario-like 2D platform single player game will be developed. In this game, the player will try to reach a goal by
overcoming various obstacles and destroying various enemies. However our game will adapt to a more shooter
based approach while including a unique a color system that we will implement . This system allows the player 
to change its color to switch the types of bullets he/she can shoot and also effect its interactions with the 
game environment. Bullets will only be able to harm enemies that posses the same color as itself. The game will
contain  power-ups such as med-kits, increase bullet power, speed-up etc. The enemies will have different behaviours
(eg. simply walk left-right, shoot if the player is in the direction it is facing, constantly jump while moving etc.).
